      <p>The gray wolf is one of the world's best known and most researched animals, with probably more books written about it than any other wildlife species. It has a long history of association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral
        communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies.</p>
